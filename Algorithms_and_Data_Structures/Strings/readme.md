# String Manipulation
=====================

This Python script demonstrates various commonly used string methods in Python using a sample string. The script showcases how these methods can be applied to transform, manipulate, and evaluate strings.

## Table of Contents


### Overview : 

This script uses a sample string `"  Hello World 123!   "` and applies different string methods like `upper()`, `lower()`, `replace()`, `find()`, etc. It outputs the result of each method applied to the string. This is useful for understanding how string manipulation works in Python.

### String Methods Used : 

Below are the string methods used in this script along with their purpose:

1. `upper()` – Converts all characters to uppercase.
2. `lower()` – Converts all characters to lowercase.
3. `capitalize()` – Capitalizes the first letter of the string.
4. `title()` – Capitalizes the first letter of each word.
5. `swapcase()` – Swaps the case of each character.
6. `strip()` – Removes leading and trailing spaces.
7. `lstrip()` – Removes leading spaces.
8. `rstrip()` – Removes trailing spaces.
9. `replace()` – Replaces a substring with another substring.
10. `find()` – Finds the first occurrence of a substring.
11. `rfind()` – Finds the last occurrence of a substring.
12. `index()` – Returns the index of the first occurrence of a substring.
13. `rindex()` – Returns the index of the last occurrence of a substring.
14. `startswith()` – Checks if the string starts with a given substring.
15. `endswith()` – Checks if the string ends with a given substring.
16. `isalpha()` – Checks if all characters are alphabetic.
17. `isdigit()` – Checks if all characters are digits.
18. `isalnum()` – Checks if all characters are alphanumeric.
19. `isspace()` – Checks if the string consists only of whitespace.
20. `isupper()` – Checks if all characters are uppercase.
21. `islower()` – Checks if all characters are lowercase.
