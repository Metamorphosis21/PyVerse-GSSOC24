## üìñ Overview
The Economic Regime Detection project aims to identify and classify different market regimes using historical stock price data. By leveraging advanced data analysis techniques, this project provides insights into market behavior, which can be beneficial for traders and investors.

## üöÄ Problem Statement
Accurately detecting market regimes is essential for making informed investment decisions. Traditional methods often struggle with the dynamic nature of financial markets, leading to less reliable forecasts. This project seeks to implement a robust detection mechanism to enhance market analysis.

## üí° Proposed Solution
The project utilizes time series analysis and clustering techniques to classify market regimes based on historical data.

### Key Components

| Component                | Description                                                      |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Collection**      | Gathering historical stock price data using Yahoo Finance.      |
| **Data Preprocessing**   | Calculating daily returns, moving averages, and volatility.     |
| **Feature Engineering**   | Creating relevant features for clustering.                      |
| **Clustering**           | Applying K-Means clustering to identify distinct market regimes. |
| **Analysis**             | Evaluating and labeling identified regimes.                     |
| **Model Validation**     | Backtesting the regimes to assess performance.                  |

## üì¶ Installation & Usage
To set up the project environment, ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:

| Library           | Purpose                                      |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `pandas`          | Data manipulation and analysis.             |
| `numpy`           | Numerical operations.                        |
| `matplotlib`      | Data visualization.                          |
| `scikit-learn`    | Machine learning and model evaluation.      |
| `yfinance`        | Access to historical stock data.            |

To install the required libraries, use the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn yfinance
```
## ‚öôÔ∏è Alternatives Considered
Several alternative approaches were evaluated for regime detection:

| Alternative Approach       | Description                                                     |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Traditional Machine Learning** | Algorithms like SVM and k-NN; effective but less robust.     |
| **Time Series Models**     | ARIMA and GARCH; good for forecasting but less for regime detection. |

## üìä Results
The model aims to provide a high accuracy in recognizing economic regimes, enabling traders to strategize accordingly. Through analysis, distinct regimes such as Bull, Bear, and Neutral can be identified.

## üîç Conclusion
This project demonstrates the importance of economic regime detection in financial markets. By employing data-driven techniques, it aids in making better investment decisions and strategies.
